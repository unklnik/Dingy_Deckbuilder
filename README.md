# Dingy Deckbuilder
A basic layout for a debck building card game made with Go & [Raylib](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) requires mouse for input.

F1 Key: Debug

F2 Key: New Level

F3 Key: Player Death Animation

F4 Key: Map On/Off


I got very bored of making it though perhaps you have some use for the code.
